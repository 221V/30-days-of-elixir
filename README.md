# 30 Days of Elixir

A walk through the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) language, one made-up exercise per day for 30 days.

### You have to start somewhere.

**01-hello-world.exs** - We start at the very beginning: our first message to the world!

**02-unit-testing.exs** - We'll need unit testing for the rest of the excercises, so let's do this! The built-in unit testing library ExUnit is capable and easy-to-use.

**03-input-output.exs** - Here we learn that file input and user input are easy. Jos√© has even done us a solid and duplicated some familiar Path and File methods from Ruby.

**04-list.exs** - What's a functional language without a List? Here we learn some simple list manipulation, and for awhile we can pretend lists are like our familiar Ruby arrays. :-)

**05-dict.exs** - Dict and Keyword structures are a bit of a departure from the Hash in Ruby world. Sure, it's an associative array, but wrapping our minds around Keyword vs HashDict vs ListDict can be confusing. Luckily, it seems we can simplify by defaulting to [HashDict.new](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/HashDict.html#new/0) and all the [Dict methods](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/Dict.html) for manipulation.

**06-record.exs** - Where are beloved objects? In functional programming, data is just data, and Elixir gives you the Record structure to organize it a bit. Records are a little like Struct from other imperative languages, except of course they are immutable!

**07-fibonacci.exs** - You learn recursion by using recursion! We learn about multiple methods of the same name, pattern matching, and guard clauses, cool! Finally we do it all over again, backwards! (Hey, why not?)

### Learning is a Process.

**08-process-ring.exs** - TBW

**09-ping.exs** - TBW

### So, do you Sudoku?

**10-sudoku-board.exs** - TBW

**11-sudoku-solver.exs** - TBW

**12-sudoku-solver-norvig.exs** - TBW

### Spades, cuz they look like little shovels!

**13-card-deck.exs** - TBW

**14-spades.exs** - TBW

### Tease your brain, but don't be a bully.

**15-quine.exs** - TBW

**16-euler-tree.exs** - TBW

**17-dining-philosophers.exs** - TBW

### OTP, hey you know me!

**18-gen_server.exs** - TBW

**19-supervisor.exs** - TBW

### Let's build a web...

**20-inets.exs** - TBW

**21-wiki.exs** - TBW

**22-socket-server.exs** - TBW

### What's this doing here?

**23-digest.exs** - TBW

**24-stream.exs** - TBW

**25-set.exs** - TBW

### The Rat Pack didn't have Macros.

**26-frank.exs** - TBW

**27-frank-2.exs** - TBW

**28-frank-3.exs** - TBW

### You'll never learn if you don't Trie.
